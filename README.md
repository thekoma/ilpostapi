## Description

A simple and fast reverse proxy for the "Il Post" podcast API. This application provides easy access to the latest podcast episodes, allowing users to quickly find and listen to their favorite content.

## API Endpoints

This application mirrors the endpoints of the original "Il Post" podcast API, providing the same functionality with potentially improved performance. Please refer to the official "Il Post" API documentation for a complete list of endpoints and their usage.

**Note:** This application acts as a reverse proxy and does not introduce any new API endpoints.

## Credentials

This application does not require any authentication or API keys.
